Principles of Logistics: The Jovian Grid

1. Transmission: The "Pole-Sitter" Solution

To avoid "Solar Conjunction" (communication/power blackouts when the Sun is between Earth and Mars), we utilize Out-of-Plane Relays.

The Statite (Static Satellite)

Location: North and South Solar Vertices (High above the Ecliptic).

Propulsion: Massive Solar Sails balance the Sun's gravity, allowing the station to "hover" rather than orbit.

The Triangle: Creates a permanent line-of-sight between Jupiter (Source) and Mars/Earth (Sink).

The Two-Leg Protocol

Leg 1 (Vacuum): High-Frequency Laser.

Source: Jupiter Swarm.

Target: Relay Station.

Benefit: Tight beam coherence over long distances.

Leg 2 (Planetary): Microwave Maser.

Source: Relay Station.

Target: Mars Surface / Earth Rectenna.

Frequency: 2.45 GHz or 5.8 GHz.

Benefit: Penetrates clouds, dust storms, and atmosphere with minimal loss.

2. Export: The Olympus Mons Railgun

Location: Flank of Olympus Mons (Mars).

Altitude: ~20km (Above 95% of Martian atmosphere).

Function: Electromagnetic Mass Driver.

Cargo: Aerodynamic shells containing refined metal ingots.

Physics: Reaches escape velocity without chemical rockets.

Safety: "Dumb" projectiles are difficult for pirates to intercept or hack.

3. Storage: The Mars Vault

Security: Deep subterranean storage.

Strategic Reserve: Controls the flow of precious metals to Earth to maintain market stability.
