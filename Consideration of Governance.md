The Promethean Charter: Governance of the Martian Federation

1. Identity

We are Prometheans. We do not just inhabit Mars; we power it. We are the fire-bringers of the outer solar system.

2. Economic Sovereignty (The "Anti-Company Town" Act)

Owner-Operator Model: Every citizen has the right to own their means of production. Equipment is financed via low-interest DAO loans, not rented.

The Joule ($J): The currency of the realm.

Backing: 1 Joule is legally redeemable for 1 kWh of Beam Energy.

Stability: Energy is the fundamental constraint of space; therefore, the currency cannot hyperinflate.

Vesting: After 5 years of contribution, citizens receive "Shares" in the Jupiter Swarm DAO, entitling them to energy dividends for life.

3. Land Protocol: "Smart Homesteading"

Proof-of-Use: Residential claims are provisional. If a structure is not built within 2 Earth Years, the Smart Contract revokes the deed.

The Harberger Tax (Commercial Land):

Owners must self-assess the value of their commercial land.

They pay a monthly tax based on that value.

The Catch: Any buyer can force a sale at that self-assessed price.

Result: Prevents land hoarding and speculation.

4. Justice: The Dual Protocol

Mercy Protocol: For non-violent infractions, the focus is restitution and community service.

Exile Protocol: For violent crimes (Murder, Sabotage), the penalty is immediate repatriation to Earth (Prison). We do not waste resources caging dangerous individuals on Mars.

5. The "Right of Return"

A portion of all Federation taxes funds a Repatriation Bond for every citizen. Any Promethean can cash this out at any time for a ticket back to Earth. Freedom to stay is meaningless without the freedom to leave.
