The Aureana Charter: Governance of the Free State

1. Identity

We are Aureans.
We are not Martians; we are not Earthlings. We are the citizens of the Golden Age. We define ourselves not by the planet we stand on, but by the abundance we create.

2. Economic Sovereignty (The "Anti-Company Town" Act)

Owner-Operator Mandate: Every Aurean has the right to own their means of production. Equipment is financed via low-interest DAO loans, not rented. You are a founder, not an employee.

The Joule ($J): The currency of the realm.

Backing: 1 Joule is legally redeemable for 1 kWh of Beam Energy.

Stability: Energy is the fundamental constraint of the universe; therefore, our currency has absolute intrinsic value.

Vesting: After 5 years of contribution, citizens receive "Shares" in the Jupiter Swarm DAO, entitling them to energy dividends for life.

3. Land Protocol: "Smart Homesteading"

Proof-of-Use: Residential claims are provisional. If a structure is not built within 2 Earth Years, the Smart Contract revokes the deed. We do not tolerate squatters.

The Harberger Tax (Commercial Land):

Owners must self-assess the value of their commercial land.

They pay a monthly tax based on that value.

The Catch: Any buyer can force a sale at that self-assessed price.

Result: Prevents land hoarding and ensures land flows to those who can generate the most value.

4. Justice: The Dual Protocol

Mercy Protocol: For non-violent infractions, the focus is restitution and community service. We build each other up.

Exile Protocol: For violent crimes (Murder, Sabotage), the penalty is immediate repatriation to Earth (Prison). We do not waste resources caging dangerous individuals in Aureana.

5. The "Right of Return"

A portion of all Federation taxes funds a Repatriation Bond for every citizen. Any Aurean can cash this out at any time for a ticket back to Earth.
Freedom to stay is meaningless without the freedom to leave.
