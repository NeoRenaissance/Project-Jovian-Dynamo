Specification: The "Sweeper" Class Mining Drones

1. Operational Doctrine: "Total Harvest"

The Sweeper fleet operates on a zero-waste philosophy. We do not blast asteroids; we consume them. The goal is to clear flight corridors (removing debris hazards) while stockpiling resources.

2. Class-1 Drone: "The Gravel Gulper"

Target: Small debris (<10m diameter) and dust.

Intake: Active Baleen System.

Counter-rotating ceramic brushes mechanically force debris into the throat.

Electrostatic nets capture fine silicate dust.

3. Class-2 Drone: "The Refinery"

Target: Volatile-rich Chondrites and Icy Bodies.

Intake: Magnetic Ram-Scoop with Cryo-Trap walls.

Internal Processing Stages

Stage A: The Vacuum Kiln (De-Gasser)

Temp: 500°C.

Process: "Baking" the rock to release trapped volatiles.

Outputs:

Water ($H_2O$) -> Liquified to Tanks.

Methane ($CH_4$) / Ammonia ($NH_3$) -> Compressed for agricultural use.

Stage B: The Carbon Press

Process: Soot and organic sludge are separated.

Action: Hydraulic compression powered by the Main Beam.

Output: Graphite Ingots and Industrial Diamond dust (for tool tips).

Stage C: The Centrifugal Fusion Forge

Temp: 3,000°C (Induction Heating).

Mechanism: Rotating drum creates artificial gravity for density separation.

Outer Layer: Heavy Metals (Platinum, Gold, Iridium).

Inner Layer: Silicate Slag.

Output:

Standardized Metal Ingots.

"Schmitz Tiles": 3D-printed interlocking bricks made from the slag. Used for radiation shielding on Mars.

4. Logistics Interface: "The Puddle Jumper"

Role: Crewed Tug/Maintenance craft.

Docking: "Smart Valve" transfer system for liquid volatiles.

Strategy: Jumpers refuel at the Drone using harvested Hydrogen/Oxygen.
