Feasibility Study: The "Real vs. Reach" Scorecard

Project: Jovian Dynamo
Date: January 2026
Purpose: To clearly delineate between proven physics and engineering challenges for potential investors and engineers.

1. Executive Summary

The Jovian Dynamo project does not rely on new physics (e.g., Warp Drive, Anti-Gravity). It relies entirely on Classical Electromagnetism and Orbital Mechanics. However, it demands a massive leap in Engineering Scale.

This document analyzes the Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of the four critical subsystems.

2. Component Analysis

A. The Electrodynamic Tethers (The Generator)

Status: REAL / PROVEN

The Physics: The equation $V = v \times B \times L$ is standard electromagnetism.

Precedent: NASA has successfully deployed tethers in space (TSS-1 and TSS-1R missions). We know they generate voltage.

The Reach (The Challenge):

Scale: Existing tests were ~20km. We require 50km.

Amperage: The sheer volume of current generated by Jupiter's field would melt standard copper.

The Fix: Graphene-Aluminum Composites and Nitinol cores. These materials exist today but have not been manufactured at 50km continuous lengths.

Verdict: High Confidence. This is a manufacturing problem, not a physics problem.

B. The Active Levitation Relay (The Downlink)

Status: PROVEN / HIGH CONFIDENCE

The Physics: "Non-Keplerian Orbits" using continuous thrust are a staple of advanced astrodynamics.

Propulsion: Ion Thrusters (Hall Effect) are mature technology (used on Starlink, Dawn, etc.).

The Upgrade: By replacing the theoretical "Solar Sail Pole-Sitter" with a beam-powered hovering station, we eliminate the need for unproven kilometer-scale structures.

The Reach (The Challenge):

Power Handling: The station must divert massive power from the main beam to its thrusters without overheating.

Redundancy: If the beam cuts out, the station eventually falls. It needs reliable backup chemical thrusters for emergency parking.

Verdict: Very High Confidence. We are using standard thrusters and standard orbits, just powered by a limitless external source.

C. High-Power Violet Lasers (The Uplink)

Status: REAL / PROVEN

The Physics: Solid-state blue/violet diodes are highly efficient (driven by the Blu-ray and industrial cutting industries).

Precedent: Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) has been tested by NASA (Psyche mission).

The Reach (The Challenge):

Pointing: Hitting a target from 750 million km away (Jupiter to Mars) requires pointing accuracy orders of magnitude better than the James Webb Space Telescope.

Thermal Management: Pumping Terawatts through diodes in a vacuum creates massive waste heat. Radiators will need to be immense.

Verdict: High Confidence. Lasers scale linearly; guidance software is the bottleneck.

D. Microwave Power Transmission (The Downlink)

Status: PROVEN

The Physics: Converting DC to RF (Microwave) and back to DC via Rectennas is well-understood.

Precedent: Caltech's SSPD-1 (Space Solar Power Demonstrator) successfully beamed power wirelessly in orbit in 2023.

The Reach (The Challenge):

Diffraction: By using the "Hover Relay" close to the planet, we have solved the massive diffraction issue of the old solar-pole strategy. Ground stations can now be reasonably sized.

Land Use: Still requires dedicated safety zones, but significantly smaller than previous iterations.

Verdict: High Confidence. The tech works; the challenge is civil engineering and land rights.

3. Strategic Conclusion: Why Now?

If this project had been proposed in 2010, it would have been science fiction. In 2026, it is Hard Engineering.

Launch Costs: Starship has lowered the cost to orbit enough to launch massive swarms.

Materials: Graphene and Nitinol are now commercially available.

AI: Guidance systems for laser pointing have improved exponentially.

Strategic Note to Partners:
We are taking things that are physically possible but economically impossible and using the unique leverage of the Outer System to force the cost down. We are not inventing magic; we are scaling physics.
